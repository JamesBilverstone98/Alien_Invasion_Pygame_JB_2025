# Alien_Invasion_Pygame_JB_2025
This is the code for the Alien Invasion project found within the Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.

Alien Invasion was created using the Pygame package.

The goal of the game is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen, in levels that increase in speed and difficulty.

**DISCLAIMER** ---
This is not my code. It is the code provided to you in the Python Crash Course book. I followed the steps to create this 2D game as one of the projects outlined in the book.
